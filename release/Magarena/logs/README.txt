=== Magarena Crash Reports ===
===

If Magarena encounters an unexpected problem it records details about the error in the "<magarena installation>\Magarena\logs" directory. Magarena should have automatically opened this directory in your file explorer if you are reading this via the Magarena crash dialog.

"crash.log" contains a full trace of where and why the error occurred.
"crash.png" is a screenshot of Magarena at the time the error occurred.

Please consider posting both of these files (or at least "crash.log") to the Magarena forum or Issue Tracker so that the development team can investigate further.

Thanks for your help.
